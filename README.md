# kmeans-ishihara-segmentation

## üß† How It Works

This project implements the **K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch** and applies it to segment **Ishihara color blindness test images** to reveal the hidden numbers.

### Step-by-step process:
1. **Image Preprocessing**  
   The input image is loaded and reshaped into a 2D array of RGB pixels.

2. **K-Means Clustering**  
   Pixels are grouped into *k* clusters using a custom NumPy-based implementation of the K-Means algorithm.

3. **Cluster Extraction**  
   After clustering, one of the clusters representing the digits (based on color) is isolated and visualized. This makes the number inside the Ishihara plate much more visible.
